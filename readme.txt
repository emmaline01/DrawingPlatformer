Drawing Platformer
by Emmaline Mai (emai, Section B)

Description:
This project is a platformer where the character jumps continuously on platforms and 
avoids enemies and obstacles. The character will fall off of the screen unless the 
player draws platforms underneath the character. Players draw in the air with a
blue pointer, and the drawings appear on the screen as platforms for the character. 
As players draw, their ink levels are reduced. When they run out of ink, they can no 
longer draw. Players get more ink by continuing to play without using ink, and it 
automatically regenerates. The character loses by falling off the bottom of the screen, 
getting pushed backwards off the screen by the obstacles, or by running out of health 
after being damaged from touching enemies, and scores are determined by total distance 
that the character bounced. The game gets harder the longer it's played, as it increases 
in speed and numbers of obstacles and enemies.

How to run the project:
Make sure the character, monster, obstacle, and mainApp files are in the same directory, 
and run the mainApp.py file
