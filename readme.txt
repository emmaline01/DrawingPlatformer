Drawing Platformer
by Emmaline Mai (emai, Section B)

Description:
This project is a platformer where the character jumps continuously on platforms and 
avoids enemies and obstacles. The character will fall off of the screen unless the 
player draws platforms underneath the character. Players draw in the air with a
blue-tipped pointer, and the drawings appear on the screen as platforms for the character. 
As players draw, their ink levels are reduced. When they run out of ink, they can no 
longer draw. Players get more ink by continuing to play without using ink, and it 
automatically regenerates. The character loses by falling off the bottom of the screen, 
getting pushed backwards off the screen by the obstacles, or by running out of health 
after being damaged from touching enemies. Scores are determined by total distance 
that the character bounced. The character can collect powerups to temporarily decrease 
the chances of enemies and obstacles appearing or slow the enemies down. The game gets 
harder the longer it's played, as it increases in speed and chances of obstacles and 
enemies appearing. Every 150m, the character passes a checkpoint. The player starts 
with 3 tries. When the character dies after a checkpoint, if the player still has 
tries, the character can restart from the last checkpoint. If there are no tries left, 
the player must restart from the beginning. After the game ends, players have the 
option of adding their name to the leaderboard, which displays the top ten highest 
scores.
